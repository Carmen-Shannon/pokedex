    <p class="info">
        Hi! Welcome to my pokedex. This app was developed as a project to help me learn some valuable skills in creating web applications. Check the F.A.Q below for some information regarding navigating the website.
    </p>
    <h2>What does this website do?</h2>
    <p class="info">
        This website allows you as a guest to search the pokedex for any pokemon by name or their national ID. It will provide every bit of information you might need on the specific pokemon you are searching for. In the future I would like to add an advanced search to allow users to search by region, type, etc. This website is a work in progress and is constantly being updated and maintained.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do I need an account?</h2>
    <p class="info">
        You don't! This website can be used by anyone without creating an account or logging in. Creating an account will allow you to save your favorite pokemon to your PC and quickly access their information on your home page with a single click!
